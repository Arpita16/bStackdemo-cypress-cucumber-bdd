# bstackdemo-cypress-cucumber-bdd

# Introduction

This project is a test automation suite built using Cypress and JavaScript with Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD). It leverages Gherkin syntax for defining human-readable test scenarios, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical team members.

# Key Components

Cypress: A JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework, known for its ease of use and real-time reloading. Cypress enables fast, reliable tests and debugging for web applications.

Cucumber Framework: By integrating Cucumber with Cypress, we can write test cases in Gherkin language, enabling BDD practices. This setup facilitates collaboration by bridging the gap between developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders.

Gherkin Syntax: Gherkin is a plain-English syntax that allows test scenarios to be written in a way that’s easy to understand and review, aligning with user stories or product requirements.

          const cucumber = require("cypress-cucumber-preprocessor").default;
              module.exports = defineConfig({
                      e2e: {
                               specPattern: "**/*.feature",
                               setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
                                         on("file:preprocessor", cucumber());
                                       },
